Wholesale site: Shopify doesn't provide "wholesale" templates. We had to find a standard template that we liked and modify the access to the site. Only botique store owners that sign a contract with us are able to have access to this website with private information.

* Created sub-menu navigation for each brand.
* Created a case pack for-loop.
* Generated "Brand" pages our product lines.
* Made a page for the Marketing Kit that includes cards with download links to our Dropbox account.
* Modified the template "featured collections" section. Changed from 3 to 4 features.
* Added a responsive video section to the homepage using existing code.
* Created "edit product" buttons for all the websites. When the admin is logged in, they can quickly jump to the backend and edit product details.

Brand sites:

* Created "Discover our Brands" top menu bar using SVG graphics.
